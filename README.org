* LC - Light Command
** USAGE
Simply write the target brightness integer.
#+begin_src
# lc device brightness
#+end_src
*Finding devices*: lc will tell you the names of devices on failure,
but if you would like to know yourself, simply run:
#+begin_src bash
$ ls /sys/class/backlight/
#+end_src
*Notice*: the brightness is a percentage, so 100 -> 100%,
not a direct write value to the device.
** BUILD
#+begin_src bash
$ make
#+end_src
** INSTALL
Simply but the =lc= file into your path, or a folder in your path.
